# Aqua Harvest React + TypeScript Project

This project is now structured for React with TypeScript support.

## Structure
- `src/` — Source files
  - `index.tsx` — Entry point for React
  - `App.tsx` — Main React component
  - `components/` — Folder for additional React components
- `public/index.html` — HTML template
- `tsconfig.json` — TypeScript configuration for React
- `package.json` — Scripts and dependencies

## Scripts
- `npm run build` — Compile TypeScript to JavaScript
- `npm start` — Run the compiled JavaScript (you may want to add a dev server for React)

## Getting Started
1. Install dependencies: `npm install`
2. Build the project: `npm run build`
3. (Optional) Set up a dev server (e.g., with Vite, Parcel, or webpack) for local development
